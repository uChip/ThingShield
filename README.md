# ThingShield
The [SparkFun Thing (WRL-13231)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231) is a board for creating Internet of Things devices based on the ESP-8266 WiFi microcontroller.  This repo contains "shield" designs in the form factor and pinout of the Thing.

ThingShield_Bare is a set (schematic and board) of design files that have the basic board outline and pinout.  Use this as the start of your own shield design.  I have left a voltage regulator circuit on the board for power.  The regulator is easily deleted if it does not meet your needs.

ThingShield_Proto is a board with prototyping area.  Again there is a voltage regulator on the shield board.  The regulator can be omitted if your design does not need much current.  Instead you can draw power directly from the Thing board.
